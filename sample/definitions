# this is just a scratch with annotations

##
Each MRS instance is a tuple ⟨gt, i, R, HC, IC⟩.
gt is the global TOP handle
i is the top INDEX
R is a bag of predications (elementary predications, or EPs, os RELS)
HC is a possibly empty bag of handle constraints (hcons, HCONS)
IC is a possibly empty bag of individual constraints (icons, ICONS)

##
Elementary predications have structure ⟨p, l, v, A⟩
p is a semantic predicate (also called a relation)
l is a scopal handle (called its label)
v is the intrinsic variable (distinguished variable, characteristic variable, arg0)
A is a possibly empty list of arguments

##
Handle constraints and individual constraints are simple triples ⟨lhs, rel, rhs⟩.
#
HCONS:
lhs (given by the feature hi, or harg) is a handle-valued slot (also called a hole)
rel is the relation of the constraint, which is one of qeq, lheq, or outscopes
rhs (given by the feature lo or larg) is the label (handle)

#
ICONS
lhs and rhs are instance variables (e.g., intrinsic variables, not handles),
rel can be any pertinent relation defined by a grammar
